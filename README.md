# Police-Killing-Visualization
In 2015 and 2016, the Guardian created a dataset and visualization called "The Counted". This dataset holds all the police killings and its details for the years 2015 and 2016. This is my own take on the visualization, highlighting what I think is important. I have no say in the politics that surrounds this issue rather, present the data.
